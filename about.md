Data will be key to understand, monitor and inform the path to achieve the [SDG goals]({{site.baseurl}}/). This website was created to host a community maintained, open repository of the SDG goals, and pointers to the underlying data.

We have compiled a **machine readable version of the SDG** goals, targets and Indicators, as well as references to the data, where it exists. To access the **raw data**, make edit suggestions or contribute, head over to the [SDG data repository](https://github.com/SDG-data/SDGs).

We use `git` data/code repositories (You can learn the [basics here](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/), and Github to host and coordinate the collaboration and community contributions ([basics here](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)).
