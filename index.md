The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a proposed set of targets relating to future international development. They are to replace the Millennium Development Goals once they expire at the end of 2015. To learn more on the SDGs background and action, go to e.g. [Open Seventeen](http://openseventeen.org/), [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals), or the [UN project page](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/).

Data will be key to understand, monitor and inform the path to achieve these Goals. This website was created to host a community maintained, open repository of the SDG goals, and pointers to the underlying data.

We have also compiled a **machine readable version of the SDG** goals, targets and Indicators, as well as references to the data, where it exists.

To access the **raw data**, make edit suggestions or contribute, head over to the [SDG data repository](https://github.com/SDG-data/SDGs).
